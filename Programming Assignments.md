# Assignments for Self-Studying Programming Languages

The following is a self-study curriculum designed to learn the core concepts of (almost) any programming language. In the process of learning the language, you should write out a [handbook](https://github.com/danielathome19/AP-Computer-Science-Principles/blob/main/Handbook%20Template.md) for the language using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) (see [Java example handbook](https://github.com/danielathome19/AP-Computer-Science-Principles/blob/main/Java%20Handbook%20Example.md)) before beginning the exercises. Research the syntax needed for the concepts before tackling the problems; they should reinforce your understanding of the syntax. A great reference point is Derek Banas on YouTube with his ["Learn X in One Video"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSX7fVd4OUFp_ODd86H0ZIY) series; also see [learnxinyminutes.com](https://learnxinyminutes.com/).

> **Note:** not all programming languages support Object-Oriented Programming concepts like classes and inheritance (although some support simple record structures like `struct` in C).


## 1. Basics

#### Concepts
