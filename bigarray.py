# 1. Print the Array from the beginning to the end
for i in range(1, len(lst)):
  print(lst[i])
  
# 2. Print the Array from the beginning to the end using a for-each loop
# 3. What number is in the middle of the Array?
# 4. What is the average of the first, last and middle numbers?
# 5. Find the smallest and the largest number in the Array
# 6. Switch the largest with smallest number. Print the list
# 7. Create a new random from 1 to 10 and insert it in the middle slot. Print the numbers.
# 8. Add 10 to every number in the List. Print all.
# 9. Replace the 3rd element in the array with 5 and print the number that was ousted (only use one method to complete this.)
# 10. What numbers are in the 50s?
# 11. What numbers are multiples of 4?
# 12. Is there a 60 in the list?
# 13. Check to see if all of the elements from front to back are in the same order from back to front
# 14. How many numbers are greater than the average?
# 15. How many of the numbers are even?
# 16. Copy all of the elements of the array into a new array but in reverse order
# 17. Write a program to shift every element of an array circularly right. E.g.-INPUT : 1 2 3 4 5 OUTPUT : 5 1 2 3 4
# 18. Find the sum of all of the digits of all of the elements
